## Introduction
Duplicate Pair Detection is a Python-based project that checks the similarity between two sentences and determines whether they are duplicate or not. This project serves as a prototype and can be further improved for applications such as research paper checking or identifying duplicate questions on platforms like Quora.

## Installation
To get started with Duplicate Pair Detection, follow these installation steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone [repository_url]
   cd duplicate-pair-detection
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
Once you have installed the necessary dependencies, you can use Duplicate Pair Detection to check for duplicate sentences or text pairs. Here's how to use it:

```python
# Import the necessary modules
from duplicate_pair_detection import duplicate_checker

# Define two sentences for comparison
sentence1 = "This is the first sentence."
sentence2 = "This is the second sentence."

# Check for similarity
result = duplicate_checker.check_similarity(sentence1, sentence2)

# Print the result
print("Are the sentences duplicate?", result)
```

## Features
- Determines the similarity between two sentences or text pairs.
- Provides a simple interface for checking duplicate pairs.
- Can be customized and extended for various applications.

## Future Improvements
This project is a basic prototype and can be further enhanced with the following improvements:
- Integration of advanced natural language processing models for improved accuracy.
- Support for bulk processing of text pairs.
- Incorporation of machine learning techniques for better duplicate detection.
- Web-based or GUI interface for user-friendly interaction.

## Sample Images
